  Fix typo in usage summary.
  
  Remove unnecessary diagnostics.

  Make archive path and save path separately configurable.  Game data
  no longer has to be stored in a writable directory.
  
  OS X: make default archive path be the Resources folder of the
  application bundle, and default save path be a new subfolder of the
  user's Library/Preferences.  The name of the subfolder is derived
  from a new "game identifier" that should be specified at the top of
  0.txt with a ";gameid Whatever" line immediately after the modeline.
