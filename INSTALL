* TO BUILD ONSCRIPTER FOR YOUR USE

This is the usual

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install


This will use gcc by default; to use icc, start with
  CC=icc ./configure


* TO BUILD A RELATIVELY REDISTRIBUTABLE ONSCRIPTER BINARY

  ./configure --with-internal-libs
  make

This will statically link as many libraries as possible into the
executable, which makes life better on systems with very primitive
application installation methods, such as OS X and Windows.

If you are compiling ONScripter for a system with modern package
management - for example, if you are creating a binary package for a
specific Linux distribution - then it will make more sense to omit the
--with-internal-libs, compile a dynamically linked executable, and
have your package depend on the regular platform-specific packages for
SDL, Freetype, and all the other dependencies.  This will simplify
your life considerably.


* NOTES

For Windows builds, use a MinGW toolchain in the MSYS environment.

OS X users have the alternative of an Xcode project kindly contributed
by Roine Gustafsson.  You'll find it in the "macosx" directory.
