  Update build system to use a configure script that generates a
  platform-appropriate makefile.  This also verifies that all required
  dependencies are available, and provides the option of building
  local libraries as required.  The end result is a package that can
  reasonably be distributed in source form for Linux users.

  In the process support for PSP, iPod, etc. has been removed; it
  could be replaced easily enough if anyone was available to test.

  Implement default data/save separation for Windows and Linux too.
  On Windows, saves go under the global Application Data folder; on
  Linux and other Unix-like systems, they go in a dotdir in the user's
  home directory.  These changes enhance Vista compatibility
  considerably, and make it possible to package Linux games in a way
  that respects the FHS.

  Fix typo in usage summary.
  
  Remove unnecessary diagnostics.

  Make archive path and save path separately configurable.  Game data
  no longer has to be stored in a writable directory.
  
  OS X: make default archive path be the Resources folder of the
  application bundle, and default save path be a new subfolder of the
  user's Library/Preferences.  The name of the subfolder is derived
  from a new "game identifier" that should be specified at the top of
  0.txt with a ";gameid Whatever" line immediately after the modeline.
