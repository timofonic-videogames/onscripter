BUGS OR MISFEATURES

* In full-page or fast-forward mode, spurious spaces are inserted at
  the start of continuation lines (or possibly line breaks are placed
  one character too early).

* OS X: should look for missing files (eg font) inside bundles, even
  if the main game data is outside the bundle.

FEATURES REQUESTED
  
* Allow the specification of a "fallback" font to use for characters
  missing from the main font -- this would make mix-and-match Japanese
  and English easier.
